        When a person creates an original work that is fixed in a physical
        medium, that person automatically owns copyright to the work. Copyright
        ownership gives the owner the exclusive right to use the work in
        certain, specific ways. Many types of works are eligible for copyright
        protection, including audiovisual words, sound recordings and musical
        compositions, written works, visual works, video games and computer
        software, and dramatic works.

        It is MoshiProject policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement
        that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C.
        § 512, and other applicable laws. MoshiProject’s response may include
        removing or disabling access to a design claimed to be infringing. If
        MoshiProject removes or disables access in response to such a notice,
        MoshiProject will make a good-faith attempt to contact the independent
        artist who submitted the design to MoshiProject so that the artist may
        make a counter-notification pursuant to Section 512(g)(2) and (3) of the
        DMCA.
